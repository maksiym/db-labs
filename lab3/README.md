    Description: The task is performed on the basis of the designed database model in lab1.
                 Re-analyze the database structure to ensure the 3rd normal form and the presence of all PKs.
                 To implement the database, write a script for its creation in the MySQL core,
                 which must meet the following criteria:
                     ❖ The SQL script can be run several times in a row
                     and errors due to existing database elements should not appear.
                     ❖ Fill with data for 10-15 INSERTs, while providing for the correct order of data insertion.
                     ❖ Create at least 2 additional indexes for the tables.
